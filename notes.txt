I started working with the raspberry pi zero 2w.
(The raspberry pi imager has the ctrl shift x to add remote login info
But it didn’t work for me so I did the full set up  and configured from the pi itself and still have plenty of space and a last resort to access it with keyboard and screen)
https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html

At first I tried a headless setup. But it really didn’t configure easily and I could not find it on the wifi

So I put a regular os installation and authorized ssh with a keyboard and screen hooked up.  
Raspberry pi zero 2 w
The user name is : gelong 
The password is : *****

You can get the host name when you open and terminal and type
hostname
you can get the ip address with 

hostname -I

the ip address was 192.168.1.14 , but perhaps this is dynamically created 
and it will be different each time

you can use the keyboard and screen to get the address

see https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-ip-address/
for some info on using ping to ping the host name (never worked for me on linux)
but it works from windows command prompt
ping gelong
or 
ping gelong.local
and you can get the ip address

if this doesn’t work you can try 
 nmap to ping all the ip addresses in a range

it may be unknown but will show the MAC address

*********************
or we could log into the router but this is a last resort as Chinese unicom router may be easy to mess up


but you may be able to just use the hostname with putty on windows and 

and vs code

ways to log in 

from windows command line 
ssh name@hostname.local

or 
ssh name@ipaddress

for example 

today I logged on through linux command line, windows command line,
using

ssh gelong@192.168.1.14
or 
ssh gelong@gelong.local 

it will ask for your password

in vs code I added an extension and was able to remote in at the bottom left corner

---------
a good way to shut down when you are working remote
is 

sudo halt
sudo shutdown -h now

raspberry pi 4 

I am flashing a new version on the Os on the raspberry pi 

I will call it 

User name will be :gregpi4

And password will be: ********

I will use vnc and ssh for this one

Some info on how that setup works is  here

https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#virtual-network-computing-vnc
A direct connection(on the same network is free)

A cloud connection which would allow connection your raspberry pi over the internet will cost some money.

I also connected raspberry pi zero (gelong) with vnc it wasn’t really useful

I imagine with this one I will be using ssh 


I can log into the gregpi4 ssh like this from the windows cmd

C:\Users\gkrei>ssh gregpi4@gregpi4.local

And enter password

I could long in to vnc the same way 

Just entering gregpi4.local  

Then entering my name and password


mv expressvpn_3.28.0.6-1_armhf.deb ~/Downloads

I downloaded the file on my windows and popped it into the directory

and then moved it arround usign the termanal
