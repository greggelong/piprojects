# piprojects
a place to hold some code an notes using raspberry pi 

---

read the text file called notes to find info of raspberry pi setup ssh info and some issues

will be going through some gpio zero documentation of some simple projects 

I am most interested in how to deal with, what I think is the weakest part of raspberry pi its lack of analog inputs.

I will see how well I can get readings from two LDRs using capacitors and timing.  Can I make a workable light following vehicle?  Will cap size, 1mf or 10mf allow for better rages?
